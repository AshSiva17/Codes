Building and updating my portfolio has been a great hands-on experience, and I’m happy with the progress I’ve made so far. If I could enhance it further, I’d focus on making the layout more appealing and experimenting with more advanced CSS features.I’m excited for the upcoming parts of the course.Overall, this course has been challenging yet rewarding, and I’m looking forward to improving my skills even more!   </p>
